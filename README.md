## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Shivani Devaraj**, a graduate student in **Applied Data Science** at the **University of Southern California**. I’m passionate about uncovering insights hidden in messy, complex datasets and transforming them into meaningful, actionable narratives.

With a strong foundation in machine learning and analytics, I bring a **storyteller’s lens** to my work—making data not only informative, but memorable. Whether it’s visualizing trends, building predictive models, or crafting end-to-end solutions, I believe that data science is most impactful when it’s both rigorous and creative.

Outside the world of numbers and code, I draw inspiration from **art and storytelling**—two passions that deeply shape how I approach problem-solving and design data experiences.

<p><strong><em>✨ Fusing computational rigor with human-centered storytelling in data & ML</em></strong></p>

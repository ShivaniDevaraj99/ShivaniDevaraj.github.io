## MY PORTFOLIO 

*A few highlights from my academic and industry work:*

**🧠 Optimizing Productivity with Behavioral Modeling**  
Used Python and SPSS to explore the effect of caffeine, exercise, and sleep on productivity using regression and hypothesis testing.

**🛰️ FrostFinder: Frost Detection on Martian Terrain**  
Developed a deep learning pipeline using CNNs (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, VGG16) to detect frost in 119K+ Mars images with OpenCV preprocessing.

**👤 AttributeMiner: Personal Attribute Extraction**  
Built rule-based systems to extract attributes (age, gender, hobbies) from image datasets—published at IEEE I2CT 2022.
